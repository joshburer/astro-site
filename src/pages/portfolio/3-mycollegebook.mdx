# MyCollegeBook


## Project Overview

Based on requirements provided by a client, I and a team of 5 others worked together to develop a native iOS and Android mobile app
that would provide a specialized campus-specific marketplace for buying and selling used college textbooks.

As planned, the team implemented the following major features:
- Creating & searching through book listings.
- Initiate meetup requests to hand off the book on-campus, providing location and time.
- Utilize Stripe for payment processing to collect fees on transactions.
- Allow users to rate their transactions and provide a score for users based on their rating.
- Provide an admin interface for moderation of the service.

The project culminated in a final presentation and demonstration at the Junior Design Expo, showcasing the app's features and functionality.

## Technology Choices

Based on the nature of mobile applications, the team decided on a client-server architecture using
React Native with Expo for the frontend, Django for the backend, and PostgreSQL for the database.
I played a leading role in this decision. Based on my ample prior experience, and some other team members'
familiarity with Python and React, we chose to develop the backend using Django, developing a REST API that
the React Native frontend would communicate with.

## My Role on the Team

During both semesters, I was one of two leading members of the team, and helped to facilitate most of the programming,
code review, documentation, communication, and bookkeeping associated with the project.

As one of the leading members of the team, and with my background in full-stack software development,
I got to play a significant role in steering the technical direction and facilitating team communication for the project.
While the technical aspects of the project were within my familiar territory,
this experience improved my leadership and managerial skills,
though I found it to be a challenge to balance with my other classes and full-time work.

Managing the distribution of tasks was a challenge, especially with varying levels of engagement from team members.
Retrospectively, I now realize the importance of assigning tasks not only based on skills but also by considering individual workloads
and interests to get people engaged. Developing clear technical communications was crucial.
I refined my ability to document and convey technical details in ways that were accessible to all team members, regardless
of their technical background.

For the future, the project has equipped me with the tools to better anticipate and mitigate challenges in team dynamics,
particularly in teams where members are splitting time between several different projects (or college classes!).
The insights gained from this project have prepared me to take on more significant leadership roles in future projects,
applying the lessons learned to improve both project outcomes and team relationships.
