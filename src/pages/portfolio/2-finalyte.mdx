# Finalyte


## Overview

Finalyte is a multi-purpose web application originally built for [DMS Inc.](https://dmsinc.us/) to help office staff and project managers collaborate
to track costs and provide transparent profit-sharing incentives for reducing costs and maximizing net profit.

Originally, the company struggled with organizing and documenting costs, simply using emails or messaging through
Microsoft Teams as their main means for project managers to send pictures of receipts for materials or equipment rental.

Instead of this, Finalyte seeks to provide an ergonomic platform to accomplish the following:
- Allow office staff to see and edit details of "Jobs", which group financial information for a specific contracted task for a given customer.
- Allow project managers to see and enter itemized financial records for only the jobs they are assigned to,
with file uploads for receipts or other supporting documents.
- Allow office staff / administrators to create accounts for project managers.
- Maintain an audit log of changes to jobs or financial records for traceability and responsibility.
- Provide reports to export financial data and provide totals for financial data per job, customer, or project manager.

### Client Communication and Requirements Gathering

This project was an interesting experience as it provided me with a chance to build software that could potentially be used for
many clients while specifically tailoring it to one. As such, I had to thoughtfully make decisions about which features to include,
how it might look, and put some extra effort into generalizing the requirements to be more widely useful.

### Technical Details

Built with Django and React, using TypeScript. It is hosted on AWS and uses PostgreSQL.
