# About Me

Hi! 👋 Thanks for checking out my website.

I'm Josh, a full-time software engineer with a Bachelor's in Computer Science 💻 at Georgia Tech.

Professionally: I have experience using Django and FastAPI on the backend and various JavaScript/TypeScript
frameworks on the frontend, especially React. This site was built
using <Icon name="vscode-icons:file-type-astro"/>[Astro](https://astro.build/), and is hosted on Github Pages!

Personally: I love building software and playing guitar. I am a member of [Christ Church of South Metro Atlanta](https://www.christsma.org/) in Tyrone, GA.

If you have any questions about me, my skills, or anything else, feel
free to reach out to me at [contact@joshuaburer.com](mailto:contact@joshuaburer.com)!
