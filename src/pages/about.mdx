# About Me

Hi! ðŸ‘‹ Thanks for checking out my website.

In case you're here wondering about me: I'm Josh, a full-time software engineer
and computer science major currently pursuing a Bachelor's in Computer Science ðŸ’» at Georgia Tech.

In my programming endeavors, I work full-stack. I have experience using Django
on the backend and various JavaScript frameworks on the frontend, especially React.

Aside from work or school, I love programming, guitar, video games, and I hope to be an avid reader.

I am a member of [Christ Church of South Metro Atlanta](https://www.christsma.org/) in Tyrone, GA.

If you have any questions about me, my skills, my church, or anything else, feel
free to reach out to me at [contact@joshuaburer.com](mailto:contact@joshuaburer.com)!
