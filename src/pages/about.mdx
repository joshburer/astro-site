# About Me

Hi! ðŸ‘‹ Thanks for checking out my website.

I'm Josh, a full-time software engineer and with a Bachelor's in Computer Science ðŸ’» at Georgia Tech.

In my programming endeavors, I work full-stack. I have experience using Django
and FastAPI on the backend and various JavaScript/TypeScript frameworks on the frontend,
especially React.

I love programming, guitar, video games, and reading.
I am a member of [Christ Church of South Metro Atlanta](https://www.christsma.org/) in Tyrone, GA.

If you have any questions about me, my skills, or anything else, feel
free to reach out to me at [contact@joshuaburer.com](mailto:contact@joshuaburer.com)!
