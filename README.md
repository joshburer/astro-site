This site was built using <span class="astro-link">[Astro](https://astro.build/)</span> in an effort to accomplish a few things:

- Keep the JavaScript payload small. (absolutely tiny!)
- Have the ability to edit site content with Markdown.
- Learn a new framework :)

<!-- TODO: Decide Github Pages vs Netlify -->

It is hosted using Github Pages following [this guide](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/deploy/github/).
